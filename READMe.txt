This project was created to practice and enhance our skills in developing API systems specifically for game development. By building a functional and scalable API, we aim to deepen our understanding of how backend systems support game mechanics, multiplayer functionality, and data management. This project serves as a hands-on learning experience, allowing us to explore game-specific backend development, integrate APIs with game engines, and implement features commonly used in modern games.
